## TN UI Customization Guide 

Users have the capability to design the UI to match their own “Look and Feel” in TransferNow User Interface. 

Users provide the information specific to their institution and their desired customizations using the following TransferNow documents: 

<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li>The Data Gathering Form (DGF) </li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</li>
<li>Email Specifications</li>
<li>Exit URL</li>
</ul>
</div>
