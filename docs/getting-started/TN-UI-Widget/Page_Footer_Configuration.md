## Page Footer Configuration

Most Fiserv-hosted pages display a footer containing Client-defined URLs that link to the Clientâ€™s Terms of Service, Security Policy, and Privacy Policy. Each URL, when selected, will result in the content being displayed in a separate pop-up window.  

Also, content that each URL points to is hosted by the Client and not Fiserv, and if the Client does not define a URL for one of the footer links, then that link will not be displayed on any applicable Fiserv hosted page.
