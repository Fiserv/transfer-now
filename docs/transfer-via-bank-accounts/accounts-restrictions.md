## Account Restrictions 


TransferNow enables a client to enforce several restrictions on added accounts. These restrictions are: 

<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li><b>External Account Limit</b>-Clients can limit the total number of external accounts a user can add 
to the TransferNow service. If the client does not set a limit, the user can add an unlimited 
number of accounts. </li>
<li><b>Suspended Accounts</b>—Negative activity such as returns on accounts will result in systematic, 
account-level suspension. Preemptive risk management processes can also manually suspend an 
account. A TransferNow user can delete a suspended account, but no suspended account can be 
reregistered until a suspension is removed. </li>
<li><b>Exception Denied Accounts</b>—Exception denials of account registration are levied through 
manual action by risk management. A user can delete an exception denied account but cannot 
re-register the account until the denial has been manually overridden by Fiserv ePayments risk 
management. </li>
<li><b>Account Usage Limit</b>—A client can configure the number of separate users that can add the 
same external account. The default limit is two. </li>
<li><b>Profile Usage Limit</b>—A client can configure the allowable number of times a single user can add 
the same account. The default limit is two. </li>
</ul>
</div>
