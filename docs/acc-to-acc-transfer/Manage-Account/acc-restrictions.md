## Account Restrictions 


TransferNow enables a client to enforce several restrictions on added accounts. These restrictions are: 

- **External Account Limit**-Clients can limit the total number of external accounts a user can add 
to the TransferNow service. If the client does not set a limit, the user can add an unlimited 
number of accounts. 
- **Suspended Accounts**—Negative activity such as returns on accounts will result in systematic, 
account-level suspension. Preemptive risk management processes can also manually suspend an 
account. A TransferNow user can delete a suspended account, but no suspended account can be 
reregistered until a suspension is removed. 
- **Exception Denied Accounts**—Exception denials of account registration are levied through 
manual action by risk management. A user can delete an exception denied account but cannot 
re-register the account until the denial has been manually overridden by Fiserv ePayments risk 
management. 
- **Account Usage Limit**—A client can configure the number of separate users that can add the 
same external account. The default limit is two. 
- **Profile Usage Limit**—A client can configure the allowable number of times a single user can add 
the same account. The default limit is two.
