## Account Restrictions 


TransferNow enables a client to enforce several restrictions on added accounts. These restrictions are: 


**External Account Limit**-Clients can limit the total number of external accounts a user can add 
to the TransferNow service. If the client does not set a limit, the user can add an unlimited 
number of accounts.</br>

**Suspended Accounts**—Negative activity such as returns on accounts will result in systematic, 
account-level suspension. Preemptive risk management processes can also manually suspend an 
account. A TransferNow user can delete a suspended account, but no suspended account can be 
reregistered until a suspension is removed.</br>

**Exception Denied Accounts**—Exception denials of account registration are levied through 
manual action by risk management. A user can delete an exception denied account but cannot 
re-register the account until the denial has been manually overridden by Fiserv ePayments risk 
management.</br>

**Account Usage Limit**—A client can configure the number of separate users that can add the 
same external account. The default limit is two.</br>

**Profile Usage Limit**—A client can configure the allowable number of times a single user can add 
the same account. The default limit is two.</br>

## Add/Delete Limitations 

Users can delete an account and re-add it. To prevent abuse of the trial deposit process, users can 
repeat this only once
