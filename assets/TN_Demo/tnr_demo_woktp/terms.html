          <p class="pageheader" align="center"><strong>ADDENDUM A</strong></p>
          <p>This Addendum A is incorporated by this reference into the Comerica Web Banking® Terms and Conditions ("Terms").  Capitalized terms used in this Addendum A and not defined in this Addendum A will have the meanings assigned in the Terms. Also, the terms and conditions of this Addendum A supplement and modify, to the extent provided in this Addendum A, the Terms.  In the event that this Addendum A is inconsistent with the Terms, then the terms of this Addendum A will govern (to the extent of the inconsistency).  This Addendum A provides the terms and conditions for transferring funds among your deposit accounts held at Comerica Bank and your deposit accounts held at other financial institutions located in the United States via our external funds transfer service ("External Funds Transfer Service" or "Comerica External Transfer service") offered through Comerica Web Banking®. </p>
          <p><strong>Authorization for External Funds Transfer Service.</strong> By requesting and using the transfers between external accounts function of our Comerica Web Banking® services, depending on the type of transfer you request, you authorize us to: (i) debit your external deposit account held at the financial institution you designate and credit that amount to your internal deposit account held at Comerica Bank; or (ii) debit your internal deposit account held at Comerica Bank and transfer those funds to your external deposit account held at the financial institution you designate. You acknowledge that: (i) Comerica Bank may choose the payment mechanism to execute your request to transfer funds using the External Funds Transfer Service, including, but not limited to, check, wire, correspondent bank transfer or Automated Clearing House ("ACH"); (ii) all of your requests for transfers using the External Funds Transfer Service must comply with the provisions of U.S. law; (iii) Comerica Bank is not required to give you next day notice after Comerica Bank's receipt of a returned or rejected external transfer request or of any ACH credit for a rejected or returned external transfer request, instead notification is sufficient by posting the recredited amount to the applicable deposit account used for the debit and listing it on your periodic statement; and (iv) the rules governing the ACH credits and debits will not apply to any type of transfer request for which the ACH was not actually utilized.</p>
          <p><strong>Types of Transfers; Cancelling Transfers.</strong><br>
            <strong>•</strong> Description of External Transfers. The External Funds Transfer Service allows you to: (i) transfer funds from your Comerica Bank deposit accounts to your external deposit accounts held in your name at other financial institutions (commonly referred to as outgoing external transfers); and (ii) transfer funds from your external deposit accounts held in your name at other financial institutions into your Comerica Bank deposit accounts (commonly referred to as incoming external transfers). Your external deposit accounts must be with a U.S. financial institution.  If not, then any credits or debits to such deposit accounts will be rejected by the External Funds Transfer Service. <strong>Unless specifically stated otherwise, the term "external transfer" includes both outgoing and incoming external transfers.</strong><br>
            <strong>•</strong> Single or Recurring External Transfers. An external transfer may be scheduled at a time up to 365 days in advance of the date the transfer is to be made, or may be set up as an automatic recurring transfer to be made at substantially regular intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly, etc.) in the same amount between the same two deposit accounts held in your name (called "Make Recurring"). External transfers can only be set up by accessing our Comerica Web Banking® through our Internet website.<br>
            <strong>•</strong> Cancelling External Transfers. You can cancel any external transfer that has not been processed by using online instructions provided on our "Transfer Activity" tab. For Make Recurring transfers, you can skip the next scheduled Make Recurring transfer, or cancel all Make Recurring transfers using the cancellation process outlined on our "Activity" tab. For Standard or High Limit External Transfers, you must transmit your request to skip or cancel an external transfer before 1:00 a.m. (ET) on the next business day the external transfer is scheduled to occur. For Next Business Day External Transfers, you must transmit your request to skip or cancel an external transfer before 8:00 p.m. (ET) on the business day the external transfer is scheduled to occur.  If you do not meet these deadlines, Comerica Bank may not have sufficient time to process your cancellation instruction, which means your external transfer may be processed as you originally scheduled it. </p>
          <p><strong>Consumer Accounts.</strong> For purposes of this Addendum A, the term "Consumer Accounts" refers to deposit accounts that are established by individuals for personal, family or household purposes only.</p>
          <p><strong>Business Days.</strong> For purposes of this Addendum A, Comerica Bank's business days are Monday through Friday. Holidays are not included.</p>
          <p><strong>Codes.</strong> For purposes of this Addendum A, the term "code" refers collectively and individually to your password, user ID, and any required authentication information or other means to access Comerica Web Banking® or the External Funds Transfer Service.</p>
          <p><strong>Contact in Event of Unauthorized Transfer. </strong> If you believe that your code has been lost or stolen, then you should call: 
            888.444.9876<br>
            <br>
            or write:<br>
            <br>
            Comerica Web Banking<br>
            1717 Main Street, MC 2325<br>
            Dallas, Texas 75201<br>
            <br>
            You should also call the number or write to the address listed above if you believe a transfer has been made using the information from your check without your permission. </p>
          <p><strong>Consumer Liability. This Section "Consumer Liability" only applies to Consumer Accounts. </strong> Tell us AT ONCE if your code has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using information from your check.  Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of the credit).  If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your code, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your code without your permission.<br>
            <br>
            If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your code, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your code without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.<br>
            <br>
            Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by code or other means, tell us at once.  If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had us in time.  If a good reason (such as long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, then we will extend the time periods.<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Periodic Statements. </strong> You will get a monthly account statement (unless there no transfers in a particular month).  In any case, you will get the statement at least quarterly.</p>
          <p><strong>Preauthorized External Transfers. This "Preauthorized External Transfers" Section only applies to Consumer Accounts. </strong></p>
          <p>Right to Stop Payment and Procedure for Doing So.  If you wish to stop an external transfer you set up through the External Funds Transfer Service, then you may do so by following the steps outlined above under the heading "Types of Transfers; Cancelling Transfers" at least two business days before it is scheduled. In addition, you can call us at 888.444.9876 or write to Comerica Bank at: Comerica Web Banking, 1717 Main Street, MC 2325, Dallas, Texas 75201 in time for us to receive your request three business days or more before the external transfer is scheduled to be made.  If you call, then we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Preauthorized Transfer.</strong> If you order us to stop an external transfer that you set up through the External Funds Transfer Service, 3 business days or more before the external transfer is scheduled, and we not do so, then we will be liable for your losses or damages proximately caused by us.</p>
          <p><strong>Liability of Comerica Bank. This "Liability of Comerica Bank" Section only applies to Consumer Accounts. </strong> If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, then we will be liable for your losses or damages proximately caused by us.  However, there are some exceptions.  We will not be liable, for instance.</p>
          <p>1.  If, through no fault of ours, you did not have enough money in your account to make a transfer.<br>
            2.  If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.<br>
            3.  If the External Funds Transfer Service or your computer, mobile device or tablet was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.<br>
            4.  If circumstances beyond our control (such as a fire or flood) prevents the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that Comerica Bank had taken.<br>
            5.  There may be other exception stated in our agreement with you.</p>
          <p><strong>Error Resolution Notice.  This "Error Resolution Notice" Section only applies to Consumer Accounts.</strong> In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers, Telephone us at 888.444.9876 or write us at Comerica Web Banking, 1717 Main Street, MC 2325, Dallas, Texas 75201 as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.  We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.</p>
          <p>(1)  Tell us your name and account number (if any).<br>
            (2)  Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error and why you need more information.<br>
            (3)  Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<br>
            <br>
            If you tell us orally, then we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.<br>
            <br>
            We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.  If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.<br>
            <br>
            If we need to do this, then we will credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your compliant or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, then we may not credit your account.<br>
            <br>
            For errors involving new accounts, point of sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.  For new accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.<br>
            <br>
            We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation.  If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.  You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>
          <p><strong>Confidentiality. </strong> We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:</p>
          <p>(i)  Where it is necessary for completing transfers, or<br>
            (ii)  In order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, or<br>
            (iii)  In order to comply with government agency of court orders, or<br>
            (iv)  If you give us written permission. </p>
          <p><strong>Password, Security and Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers for Business Accounts. </strong> The codes are the security procedures. You agree that we may use the security procedures to verify the authenticity of external transfer request delivered to us in your name through the External Funds Transfer Service.  If we verify the authenticity of the external transfer request using the security procedures, then we may rely on it and you will be obligated on the external transfer request whether or not the external transfer request was authorized by you. Also, if the external transfer request was authorized by you, then you will be obligated on the external transfer request even if we did not verify its authenticity using the security procedures and even if the security procedures would have prevented error. You agree that the security procedures are intended to verify authenticity and not to detect error.<br>
            <br>
            You agree to notify us in the event your use of the External Funds Transfer Service would necessitate or be better served by a level of security that exceeds that offered by the security procedures. If you fail to notify us, then you acknowledge and agree that the security aspects of the External Funds Transfer Service are appropriate for your needs and will provide you with commercially reasonable degree of security against unauthorized use for the size, type and frequency of transfers you use the External Funds Transfer Service to accomplish.</p>
          <p><strong>Eligibility for External Transfers.</strong> External Transfers can only be made from checking, savings and money market deposit accounts.</p>
          <p><strong>Limitations on External Transfers.</strong> There are both dollar and frequency limitations on transfers conducted through the External Funds Transfer Service.</p>
          <p><strong>Dollar Limitations</strong></p>
          <p>Each external transfer request through the External Funds Transfer Service has a minimum requirement of $10.00. Also, the dollar limitations set forth below for each type of external funds transfer apply independently to outgoing and incoming transfers of the same type.<br>
            <br>
            However, when it comes to the dollar limits for "all outstanding external transfers," all outgoing and incoming transfers that are "outstanding" will be aggregated and included in the calculation for the "limit on all outstanding external transfers."  Moreover, the dollar limits for "all outstanding external transfers" discussed below are the maximum dollar amounts that can be "in process" at any given time for that particular type of transfer (again, this includes both outgoing and incoming external transfer requests for the particular transfer in question, e.g. Standard External Transfer, Next Business Day External Transfer and High Limit External Transfer). When you reach your "outstanding limit" you will not be able to schedule additional external transfers (incoming or outgoing) via the External Funds Transfer service until the status indicator on the "Transfer Activity" tab shows a "Complete" status. <br>
            <br>
            Also, the dollar limitations for "Standard External Transfer" and "Next Business Day External Transfer" are independent dollar limits and are not aggregated together.   Also, it may be possible that all three types of external transfers, as listed and defined below, with their corresponding dollar limits, may not be available to you at all times.  Generally, the External Funds Transfer Service allows you to use the "Standard External Transfer" initially and then you may become eligible for "Next Business Day External Transfer" and "High Limit External Transfer." <br>
            <br>
            In order to be eligible for the Next Business Day External Transfer, you must: (i) have no history of negative activity or NSF items for 3 months using the Comerica External Transfer service; and (ii) have completed an incoming external transfer of at least $500 and 60 days have passed since that external transfer.<br>
            <br>
            In order to be eligible for the High Limit External Transfer, you must: (i) have no history of negative activity or NSF items for 3 months using the Comerica External Transfer service; and (ii) have completed an incoming external transfer of at least $1,000 and 60 days have passed since that external transfer.<br>
            <br>
            In the event that you become eligible for a "High Limit External Transfer" then those dollar limits will replace the dollar limits set forth for "Standard External Transfer."  The dollar limitations for "High Limit External Transfer" and "Next Business Day External Transfer" are independent dollar limits and are not aggregated together.<br>
            <br>
            In order to determine your current eligibility to engage in a "Next Business Day External Transfer" or a High Limit External Transfer" please click on the icon next to the "Amount" box on the "Add Transfer" tab.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, based on your use of the External Funds Transfer Service and status of your deposit accounts associated with the External Funds Transfer Service we may terminate your ability to use "High Limit External Transfer" and "Next Business Day External Transfer" from time to time. </p>
          <p align="left"> <strong>•</strong> Standard External Transfers.  The term "Standard External Transfer" or Standard External Transfers" refers to both incoming and outgoing requests to transfer money that require a minimum of three (3) Business Days to be completed.

          <p><strong>Our right to reject External Transfers.</strong> We may reject an external transfer for any reason.  We will notify you of such rejection (either electronically, in writing, by telephone or as otherwise agreed by you and Comerica Bank) no later than the business day after the Effective Entry Date, as that term is defined in the ACH rules. Also, we reserve the right to complete or to reject any attempted external transfer that exceeds or is lower than the applicable dollar limit or exceeds the available balance in your account, at our complete discretion, and, regardless of our decision in that regard, you understand that such attempted or completed external transfers may subject your deposit account to an overdraft fee as stated in the Personal Services and Charges and Business Account Service Charges and Interest Information brochures.</p>
          <p><strong>Frequency Limitations.</strong> In addition to those limitations for external transfers elsewhere described, there are frequency limits that apply when transferring funds from a savings or money market account.  You may make a maximum of 6 preauthorized, automatic or telephone transfers per monthly statement cycle on a savings or money market account.  No more than 3 of the 6 transfers may be made by check, draft, debit or similar order made by you and payable to third parties.  If you exceed these limits, then Comerica Bank may close the savings or money market account or reconvert the savings or money market account to a non-interest bearing account. Also, Comerica Bank will impose a fee for each transfer that exceeds these limits.  (See Comerica's Personal Services and Charges and Business Account Service Charges and Interest Information brochures for applicable fees for exceeding these limits.) Each external transfer that you request through the use of the External Funds Transfer Service from your money market or savings account counts as one of the six transfers that you are permitted each monthly cycle.</p>
          <p><strong>Other limitations.</strong> We reserve the right to limit the frequency and dollar amount of transactions from any of your deposit accounts for security reasons. In addition, it is possible that your external deposit accounts held at other financial institutions are subject to dollar and frequency limitations that will affect your ability to conduct your requested external transfers. We will not be liable to you for any external transfer that cannot be completed in accordance with your instructions due to limitations imposed by other financial institutions.</p>
          <p><strong>Provisional Payment.</strong> There is an ACH rule that makes payment of an ACH credit entry provisional until the financial institution, which holds the deposit account that is credited for the ACH credit entry, is in receipt of final settlement for such ACH entry. You specifically agree and acknowledge that you have received notice of this ACH rule.  Further, if there is no final settlement, then the financial institution will be entitled to a refund from the person who authorized the ACH credit entry (which also should be you since the deposit account is yours) and you will not be deemed to have paid the amount of the ACH credit entry.  For example, if you initiate an external funds transfer request where funds are coming from your external deposit account held at another financial institution in order to be credited to your internal deposit account held at Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank credits you the amount of the external funds transfer request and you do not have the money in your external deposit account held with your financial institution to settle the external transfer request, then we may debit your deposit account that you hold with Comerica Bank in the amount of the ACH credit entry and you will not be deemed to have paid the external transfer request. </p>
          <p><strong>External Transfer Fee.</strong> The following fees apply for each outgoing external transfer:</p>
          <p> <strong>•</strong> Standard External Transfer Fee:    $3.00<br>
            <strong>•</strong> Next Business Day External Transfer Fee:                          $10.00<br>
            <br>
            We do not impose any fees for incoming external transfers.</p>
          <p><strong>Reliance on Your Instructions.</strong> We are not responsible for detecting any errors in any transfer requested by you through the External Funds Transfer Service. You are responsible for the content of any external transfer instruction and Comerica Bank may rely upon the information you provide to Comerica Bank when processing the external transfer instruction. Comerica Bank and any other financial institution may rely solely on the account numbers and bank identifying numbers that you provide to Comerica Bank for identifying your external deposit account, and financial institution(s) holding such accounts, regardless of whether or not you also provide the name of the account holder or the name of the financial institution. We and other financial institutions processing your external transfers have no responsibility to identify or investigate any discrepancy between names and account numbers. Also, your obligation to pay the amount of any external transfer request will not be excused in circumstances where your external transfer request describes the name and account number inconsistently or the name and indentifying number of the financial institution inconsistently.</p>
          <p><strong>Verification of Identity and Account Ownership.</strong> When you register for the External Funds Transfer Service, you also authorize Comerica Bank to obtain information from any financial institutions holding your external deposit accounts in order to confirm your access to and/or ownership of the external deposit accounts. You also authorize Comerica Bank to request information regarding you and your external deposit accounts from other third party sources to verify your identity, account ownership, protect against fraud, confirm your pattern of use or exceptional use, comply with applicable law or otherwise as is reasonably necessary to provide the External Funds Transfer Service to you. Comerica Bank is under no obligation to you or any other person to verify or confirm your registration information or your ownership of the external deposit accounts or to confirm that your deposit accounts held at Comerica Bank and the external deposit accounts at another financial institution are held in the same name and/or legal capacity. You represent and warrant that your deposit accounts held at Comerica Bank and the external deposit accounts held at another financial institution that utilize the External Funds Transfer Service are held in the same name or legal capacity or you have the authority to make deposits and withdrawals.  You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your external deposit accounts held at other financial institutions and you agree to not misrepresent your identity or your deposit account information.</p>
          <p>The External Funds Transfer Service may use up to three methods for you to verify your control and authority to access the external deposit accounts held at other financial institutions. You must undertake one of these account verification options in order to use the External Funds Transfer Service. These three account verification options are as follows:</p>
          <p><strong>Instant Verification.</strong> You authorize and agree that Comerica Bank is able to verify your account ownership to any external deposit account held in your name at another financial institution that you set forth in any external transfer request by using a shared database that is used by participating financial institutions to verify account ownership of account owners. Further, you authorize and agree that Comerica Bank can provide your personal information obtained at account opening with the shared database.  However, online access credentials, such as username and password, will not be disclosed to the shared database.   Specifically, any information released to the shared database will be information that is already known by your financial institution that holds your external account.</p>
          <p><strong>Real Time Verification.</strong> You provide Comerica Bank with your online credentials (such as username and password) in order to access your external deposit accounts held at another institution online, and thereby verify your control and authority to access the external deposit accounts. If you select this option for verification, you authorize us to access websites and online banking systems of the financial institution holding your external deposit account, on your behalf, to retrieve information about your accounts. For all purposes hereof, you hereby grant us a limited power of attorney, and you hereby appoint us as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and re-substitution, for you and in your name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to access third party Internet sites (including the website of the financial institution that holds the external deposit account(s)), servers or documents, retrieve information, and use your information, all as described above, with the full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with such activities, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could do in person.<br>
            <br>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN WE ACCESS AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, WE ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT THE AGENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY. You agree that third party financial institutions holding the external deposit account shall be entitled to rely on the foregoing authorization, agency and power of attorney granted by you. You understand and agree that use of this verification process is not endorsed or sponsored by the financial institutions holding the external deposit account(s), and you are not required to provide us with your online credentials in order to use the External Funds Transfer Service. You are licensing to us any information, data, passwords, materials or other content (collectively, Content) you provide to us. We may use, modify, display, distribute and create new material using such Content in order to provide the requested External Funds Transfer Service to you. By submitting Content, you automatically agree that we may use the Content for the purposes set out above without any particular time limit and without the payment of any fees.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge Deposits.</strong> By using the Challenge Deposit Verification Service, you authorize Comerica Bank to make up to two micro-deposits (less than $1.00) to the external deposit accounts specified by you. You will thereafter verify to Comerica Bank the amounts of each micro-deposit made to the external deposit account owned by you and held at another financial institution.</p>
          <p><strong>Suspension and Reinstatement of Transfer Service.</strong> In the event that we, at any time, incur a problem with your use of the External Funds Transfer Service, including without limitation, the inability to debit any of your external deposit accounts or to collect funds with respect to any of your transfers, as described above, and without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under the Terms, this Addendum A or otherwise, we reserve the right to suspend your right to use the External Funds Transfer Service, immediately and without prior notice to you. You understand and agree that such action is reasonable for us to take in order to protect Comerica Bank and you from potential losses. In the event of such suspension, you may request reinstatement of your External Funds Transfer Service by contacting us at 888.444.9876.<br>
            <br>
            We reserve the right in our sole discretion to grant or deny reinstatement of your use of the External Funds Transfer Service. Comerica Bank reserves the adjust the applicable Dollar and/or Frequency Limitations at any time. </p>
          <p><strong>Termination.</strong> The External Funds Transfer Service remains in effect until it is terminated by either you or by us. You may cancel your External Funds Transfer Service at any time by calling Comerica Customer Service at 888.444.9876. The External Funds Transfer Service will be canceled after we have had a reasonable opportunity to act upon your cancellation request. You agree to use the External Funds Transfer Service only for bona fide and lawful purposes. We may suspend or terminate your participation in the External Funds Transfer Service for any reason, at any time. We will try to notify you in advance, but we are not obligated to do so. Any transfers we have already processed before the termination date will be completed. We recommend that you cancel any scheduled transfers prior to notifying us that you are terminating the External Funds Transfer Service. You are responsible for any transfers scheduled by you prior to termination that you have not canceled. Termination will not affect your liability or obligations under the Terms or this Addendum A for transfers we have processed on your behalf.</p>
          <p><strong>No Obligation to Honor Instructions.</strong> We shall have no obligation to honor any instruction, in whole or in part, that (a) is, or that we reasonably believe is used for, any illegal or improper purpose or activity; (b) exceeds the available funds in your deposit account; (c) we have reason to believe may not be authorized by you; (d) involves funds subject to a hold, dispute or legal process; (e) would violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to us, the External Funds Transfer Service, you or any other party that processes or receives the payment; (f) is not in accordance with any other requirement stated in the Terms or this Addendum A, or any other applicable agreement with us, or any of our policies, procedures or practices; or (g) for our protection or yours, we have reasonable cause not to honor. We reserve the right to refuse to honor an instruction or suspend or terminate the External Funds Transfer Service, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without cause and without notice, and may immediately do so including, without limitation, if: (i) we have reason to believe that your deposit account has been compromised or mismanaged in any way, such as by unauthorized or erroneous use of your password; or (ii) we believe the External Funds Transfer Service is not being used for its intended, bona fide and lawful purposes under this Agreement; (iii) you repeatedly overdraw your deposit accounts at Comerica Bank; or (iv) your deposit account at Comerica Bank is closed or access to your deposit account is restricted for any reason.</p>

If you have a problem or question about your account at another financial institution, please contact your other financial institution directly. Please remember that use of your account at another financial institution is subject to that financial institution's rules and regulations governing your account, and we are not liable or responsible for any cost or losses incurred as a result of your external transfer requests from and/or into such accounts.<br>
